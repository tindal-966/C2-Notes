# Description
I learn it by myself this day but I found this answers of this book isn't completed.

So I want to make it completed, I note my practice on this repository.

I hope it can help you who like me study it by yourself.

# Attention
Because I used this Chinese Edition book and I'm a poor English learner, so used Chinese to **Comment** .c file, if you computer didn't install Chinese Font, you may see many random code in the comment, please feel free.

I think **Code without borders**, so this problem can't trouble you.

Maybe I will used bilingual in Comment or try my best to no comment.

# More and more importance
Just coding the Exercises and Programming Projects by your hand on your computer, keep think, try and correct it.

I suggest you don't see the answers if you don't run your projects third times at least.

**I hope this answers can inspire you!
